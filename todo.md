## Felt Experience Fixes (Priority)
- [x] Landing page hero: add emotional problem statement above the headline ("You have the vision. You have the books. Something still isn't clicking.")
- [x] Landing page hero: add right-side visual panel (dashboard mockup or pathway card) for asymmetric premium layout
- [x] Landing page: add a "Where do I begin?" anchor section with a single clear first step for overwhelmed visitors
- [x] Alignment Audit: add a warm welcome screen before Q1 (context, reassurance, time estimate)
- [x] Alignment Audit: add a progress bar that is visually prominent (not just text "Q1 of 10")
- [x] Alignment Audit: results page must feel like a personalized letter, not a report card
- [x] Dashboard: add a "Your Next Step" hero card at the top (one clear recommended action, not a grid of options) (one clear recommended action, not a grid of options)
- [x] Dashboard: empty states ("No habits yet", "Journal is empty") should feel inviting, not clinical
- [x] Dashboard: Daily Check-in button is now primary/filled and always visible — it is the most important daily action
- [x] Oracle page: add a brief orienting paragraph explaining what the Oracle is and how it works explaining what the Oracle is and how it works before the prompt buttons
- [x] Pricing page: rename tiers to match the platform language (Explorer/Seeker/Oracle — verified consistent) (Explorer/Seeker/Oracle already done — verify consistency with landing page which says Free/Core/Premium)
- [ ] Pricing page: add a "What's the difference?" plain-language comparison below the cards
- [x] Add legal pages: Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Refund Policy
- [x] Add Support/Contact page
- [x] Add content rights system: label all library content as Public Domain / Licensed / Original LifeOS Content
- [x] Footer: add links to legal pages, support, and social
- [ ] Pathway pages: add a "Begin This Practice" interactive button that tracks progress (not just read-only content)
- [ ] Reset After Setback: the steps should be interactive/expandable, not just static cards

## Adaptive Intelligence Layer — Wave 1

### Foundation
- [ ] Create shared language constants file (adaptive-language.ts) with all re-entry, streak, and onboarding copy
- [ ] Add DB columns for better mirror metrics: returnCount, lastReturnDate, resetSpeed, keptPromises, gentleConsistencyScore
- [ ] Generate and apply DB migration for new columns

### Low Bandwidth Mode
- [ ] Add lowBandwidthMode toggle to user preferences in DB schema
- [ ] Build LowBandwidthDashboard component: one next step, one grounding prompt, one unfinished priority, one reset option
- [ ] Add "Simplify my view" toggle button to Dashboard that activates Low Bandwidth Mode
- [ ] Ensure Low Bandwidth Mode persists across sessions (stored in user profile)

### Re-entry Button
- [ ] Add "Begin Again" / re-entry button to Dashboard — visible when user has been absent 2+ days
- [ ] Build ReentryFlow component: warm welcome back message, no guilt framing, one small win suggestion, what still matters, what can wait
- [ ] Wire Oracle to detect absence and surface a re-entry message on next visit

### Neurodivergent-Aware Onboarding
- [ ] Add "How my mind works" step to Alignment Audit (after current questions, before results)
- [ ] Build pattern self-identification UI: scattered/overwhelmed/trouble starting/time blindness/inconsistent energy/reading fatigue (non-clinical language)
- [ ] Store selected patterns in user profile for Oracle and Dashboard adaptation
- [ ] Adapt Dashboard greeting and "Your Next Step" card based on selected patterns

### Flexible Streak Logic — Better Mirror
- [ ] Replace streak-only display in StandardsModule with the Better Mirror panel
- [ ] Build BetterMirror component showing: return rate %, reset speed (avg days to return), kept promises count, gentle consistency score
- [ ] Add "You're the kind of person who returns" identity language to habit completion and re-entry flows
- [ ] Add Minimum Viable Habits: let users set full / small / tiny versions of each habit
- [ ] Remove any "broken streak" language from the entire codebase — replace with return-oriented language
- [ ] Add "Catch me before I overcommit" warning when user adds more than 5 daily habits

### Language System Documentation
- [ ] Write Adaptive Intelligence Layer Language System document (all copy, naming conventions, tone guidelines)

## Legal-Risk Scrub & Release-Readiness Pass

- [x] Rename all high-risk course/product titles (Atomic Habits for the Soul → Identity in Motion, Living in the Vortex → The Alignment Current, Finding Your Why → The Meaning Foundation, Creative Flowdreaming → Emotional Futures, Getting Into the Vortex → The Alignment State)
- [x] Update all internal references to renamed titles throughout codebase
- [x] Reframe "Teachers" section to "Wisdom Lineage" with non-affiliation disclaimer
- [x] Add non-affiliation disclaimer to About page, footer, and any page with named influences
- [x] Review and reduce direct quotes from living authors on sales-oriented pages — all living author quotes removed from sales pages
- [x] Fix rights labeling inconsistencies — all library resources now have explicit rights notes
- [x] Review Emotional Guidance Scale framing — reframed as LifeOS Emotional Compass in Oracle; EGS name retained in State module as a descriptive tool name
- [x] Review Flowdreaming/Vortex pathway framing — Flowdream Session renamed to Emotional Futures Session; all branded attributions removed from PathwayPage
- [x] Ensure all renamed items feel original, premium, and LifeOS-owned — verified
- [x] Update Terms of Service to include explicit non-affiliation language — included in legal pages
- [x] Final TypeScript check: zero errors. All 14 tests passing. Checkpoint saved.
